A place to put a set of compatible rule induction algorithms, together with preprocessors such as data binarizers, feature generators or -transformers as well as post-processors.

Contains:
1. An IBM implementation of RIPPER, see Cohen, William W: "Fast effective rule induction", Machine learning proceedings 1995, pp. 115-123
- Authors: Ke Li (Ke.Li1@ibm.com),  Yusik Kim (yusik.kim@ibm.com), Shubham Gupta (shubham.gupta1@ibm.com), Hagen Voelzer (hvo@zurich.ibm.com)
2. Rule set interchange (trxf) - a model for rule sets and common functions on them, to be used as interchange between algorithms/code producing or consuming rule sets
- Authors: Yusik Kim (yusik.kim@ibm.com), Shubham Gupta (shubham.gupta1@ibm.com), Hagen Voelzer (hvo@zurich.ibm.com)
3. More algorithms will be added over time, for more information, please contact Hagen Voelzer (hvo@zurich.ibm.com) or Yusik Kim (yusik.kim@ibm.com)
